## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul, 24, a self-taught developer. This has been my hobby since I was very young, and after exploring various professional fields, I now wish to find a job in the software development sector. I have worked on several projects, including a native Android application, a digital flow meter with Arduino and various web integrations.

In recent weeks, I've been improving my front-end skills by taking [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges, and reading feedback on both my projects and others' projects on their official discord, or as replies to challenge submissions. Also, I love transmitting my knowledge and sometimes leave feedback on their projects, too.  

I learned **React** basics with my [**CountriesAPI**](https://github.com/dev-paulL/countries-api-vite-react) and [**Desserts with cart**](https://github.com/dev-paulL/dessert-with-cart) projects and plan to explore other frameworks as well before diving deeper into a particular one. I also plan to explore back-end development.
